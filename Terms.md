# ⚖️ Saturn Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** February 15, 2026

By using fybot, you agree to these terms. If you don’t agree, don’t use it — simple as that.

## 1. Using Saturn
- You must follow Discord’s Terms of Service: https://discord.com/terms  
  and Community Guidelines: https://discord.com/guidelines
- Don’t use Saturn for spam, abuse, or anything illegal. Be cool.
- Features may change, break, or vanish anytime. No hard promises here.

## 2. Uptime & Changes
- Saturn runs on third-party services (like Render).  
  If it goes down or acts weird, we’re not liable — but we’ll try our best to keep things smooth.

## 3. No Guarantees
- Saturn is provided *as-is*. No warranties, uptime guarantees, or promises that it won’t break stuff.
- Not affiliated with Discord, OpenAI, Claude, Groq, Meta, etc.  
  We just use their public tools & APIs.
