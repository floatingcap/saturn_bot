Effective Date: June 9, 2025

By using fybot, you agree to these terms. If you don’t agree, don’t use it — simple as that.
1. Using fybot

    You must follow Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

    Don’t use fybot for spam, abuse, or anything illegal. Be cool.

    Features may change, break, or vanish anytime. No hard promises here.

2. Uptime & Changes

    fybot runs on third-party services like Replit, UptimeRobot, and others. If it goes down or acts weird, we’re not liable — but we’ll try our best to keep things smooth.

3. No Guarantees

    fybot is provided as-is. There are no warranties, uptime guarantees, or promises that it won’t act like a gremlin sometimes.

    This project isn't affiliated with Discord, OpenAI, Google, StabilityAI, Hugging Face, or anyone else. We just use their public tools & APIs.
