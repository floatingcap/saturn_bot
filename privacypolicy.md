**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]

We respect your privacy. Here's what fybot does — and doesn’t do:

## 1. What We Collect
- **User IDs** – only when needed (cooldowns, configs, etc).
- **Guild & Channel IDs** – used for server-specific settings.
- **Messages** – only processed when you use a command. Not stored unless the feature needs it.

## 2. What We Don’t Collect
- No passwords, emails, or sensitive stuff.
- No fingerprinting, tracking, or ads.
- No DMs are read unless you message fybot directly.

## 3. Data Storage & Deletion
- If any data is saved, it's kept securely on the bot’s host (like Replit).
- Want your data gone? Ask the devs or your server admin.

## 4. External Services
fybot uses some external APIs to generate stuff like text/images.  
These services may process your input per their own privacy policies:

- OpenAI: https://openai.com/privacy  
- Google (Gemini): https://policies.google.com/privacy  
- Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/privacy
